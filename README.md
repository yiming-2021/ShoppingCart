Step 1: Shopping cart
You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
Apples cost 45c and oranges cost 65c.
Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the register and outputs the total cost
For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => $2.00
Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input
Step 2: Simple offers
The shop decides to introduce two new offers
buy one, get one free on Apples
3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
Update your checkout functions accordingly
